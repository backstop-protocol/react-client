        </li>
      </ol>
      <p dir="ltr" >The Site provides information regarding SFL and the Interface. <strong>The Site and Interface&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>do not</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;offer the Protocol or the DLP, both of which are decentralized protocols on the Ethereum Blockchain, and which may be accessed independently without use of the Site or the Interface.</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr" >These Terms relate solely to the Site and the Interface. Use of the Protocol and any activity thereon is subject to the Terms of Use of the Protocol located at <u><a href="https://github.com/backstop-protocol/Terms-and-Conditions">https://github.com/backstop-protocol/Terms-and-Conditions</a></u>. Use of the DLP is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable DLP chosen by the User, and it is the User’s obligation to ensure that it reads, understands and accepts such terms and conditions prior to using the DLP. SFL is not affiliated or related to the DLP in any manner.</p>
      <p dir="ltr" ><em><strong>YOUR USE OF THE PROTOCOL AND/OR DLP IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</strong></em></p>
      <p dir="ltr" >On the Site, you will have the ability via the Interface to access the Protocol. More information about the Protocol is available here: <u><a href="https://github.com/backstop-protocol">https://github.com/backstop-protocol</a></u>.</p>
      <p dir="ltr" ><em>Decentralized Protocol</em>: The Protocol is a smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain. The Interface provides an Interface to access the Protocol in a user-friendly manner, however due to its nature as a smart contract on a public blockchain, SFL does not control the Protocol. By using the Interface, you acknowledge and recognize that use of the Protocol and/or the DLP and deposit of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets in the Protocol or DLP is at your own risk and will be subject to the rules encoded within the Protocol and the DLP, including as to when and on what terms any deposited cryptocurrencies or other digital assets may be liquidated, neither of which SFL can influence or has any control over.</p>
      <p dir="ltr" >Non-Custodial: The Interface and the Protocol are non-custodial. Users of the Protocol remain in
          control of digital assets held and transactions conducted through the Protocol at all times and
          SFL never has custody of, or any control over, those digital assets or transactions. Each user of
          the Protocol will at all times be responsible for securing the private key necessary to sign
          transactions from the blockchain address associated with deposited digital assets, and SFL will
          not have access to, or take possession of, such private key or otherwise have ability to control
          digital assets transferred, deposited, or otherwise handled using the Protocol.
          Third Party Services: Any supported DLPs accessible using the Protocol are third-party services.
          These services are not provided to users by SFL, and any access to these third-party services is
          provided for users’ convenience only and does not constitute SFL’s approval, endorsement, or
          recommendation of any such third-party services. You access and use any third-party service
          based on your own evaluation of that service and at your own risk. You understand that your use
          of any third-party service is not governed by this Agreement. If you decide to use a third-party
          service, you will be responsible for reviewing, understanding, and accepting the terms and
          conditions associated with the use of that third-party service and/or any other documentation
          governing its use. We expressly disclaim all responsibility and liability in connection with your
          use of any third-party services, including with respect to any information presented to you via the
          Site or the Interface. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of a third-party service.
          Your use of a third-party service, including any supported DLPs, is subject to that third-party
          service’s own terms of use and privacy policies.
        </p>
      <p dir="ltr" >SFL has no control over, and no duty to take any action regarding any transaction engaged in through the functionality of the Protocol and/or the DLP. SFL and its affiliates will not be held liable, and are not liable, for any acts or omissions by the DLP, or any other third party, nor are we liable, or will we be held liable, for any damage that you may suffer as a result of interacting with or using any of the mentioned or unmentioned third parties.</p>
      <p dir="ltr" ><em>Risk Disclosures Relating to the Protocol and DLP</em>. By utilizing the Interface, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, digital assets, blockchains and other distributed and decentralized systems, and smart contracts, including, but not limited to, the risks described at the risk tab in this website.</p>
      <p dir="ltr" ><em>Fees</em>. SFL does not currently charge a fee for the use of the Interface. &nbsp;However, we reser<span style={{background: 'transparent'}}>ve the right to do so in the future, and in such case shall display to you any applicable fees prior to you incurring the fee. There are fees and costs associated with using the Protocol, a description of which can be found at&nbsp;</span><u><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp"><span style={{fontStyle: 'normal'}}><span style={{fontWeight: 'normal'}}><span style={{background: 'transparent'}}>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gas-ethereum.asp</span></span></span></a></u><span style={{background: 'transparent'}}>. There may be fees and costs&nbsp;</span>associated with using the DLP, and it is the User’s obligation to ensure that it locates, understands and accepts such fees and costs prior to using the DLP</p>
      <p dir="ltr" ><em>We are not responsible for any loss</em>: The Protocol, DLP and blockchain networks are decentralized open source systems and may still under active development, and therefore: (a) may contain bugs, errors and defects, (b) may function improperly or be subject to periods of downtime and unavailability, (c) may result in total or partial loss or corruption of cryptocurrencies deposited within them and/or data and (d) may be modified at any time, including through the release of subsequent versions, all with or without notice to you. SFL will not be liable or responsible for any losses or damages to you as a result of any of the foregoing.</p>
      <p dir="ltr" >WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THE TERMS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THE INTERFACE, THE PROTOCOL AND THE DLP, ALL OF WHICH WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK. RECOGNIZING SUCH, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER SFL NOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, CRYPTOCURRENCIES OR OTHER TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE LOSSES OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER THEORY (EVEN IF SFL HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM THE SITE, THE INTERFACE, THE PROTOCOL OR THE DLP.</p>
      <p dir="ltr" >SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS THE FOREGOING WILL BE REINTERPRETED SO AS TO BE EFFECTIVE TO GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

        <li>
          <p dir="ltr" ><strong>Governance</strong></p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p dir="ltr" >
      The Protocol is designed to be governed by a decentralized voting protocol. At launch, governance was subject to a time-lock until April 26, 2021 During that time,allocated to users of the Protocol 100% of the voting control to determine the admin contract(s) that would govern the Protocol after the time-lock expired on April 26, 2021.       </p>
      <p dir="ltr" >
      The admin contracts and governance do not have any access to or control over User funds. Governance votes do have the ability to determine incentive models, backstop membership, and governance updates. As a result, governance votes may modify material aspects of the Protocol, including but not limited to the allocation of liquidation proceeds, distribution of the jar, allocation of User rating scores, and the mechanisms by which future votes are governed. SFL has no ability to control governance votes. 
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr" >
      
      By using the Protocol, you may also obtain the ability to participate in governance. Obtaining the right to participate in governance, and/or participating in governance, does not constitute an investment in the Protocol, in SFL or any of its affiliates, or in anything owned or controlled by SFL or its affiliates.      
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr" >
      Users should carefully consider whether participation in governance is suitable for them, and whether there are any consequences to such participation, in light of their individual circumstances. 
The ability to vote on a proposal, through this Interface or otherwise, does not constitute a representation that any proposal has been vetted or endorsed by SFL or any of its affiliates. SFL and its affiliates hereby expressly disclaim all representations and warranties of any kind concerning governance updates, including any representation concerning any legal consequence of participating in governance or any representation that any particular proposal on which Users may vote complies with any law, prohibition, restriction, or regulation by any government or regulatory authority in any jurisdiction. 
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr" >
      YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PARTICIPATING IN GOVERNANCE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. TO THE EXTENT YOU PARTICIPATE IN GOVERNANCE, YOU AGREE NOT TO PROPOSE, ENDORSE, OR VOTE IN FAVOR OF ANY PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE VIOLATES ANY LAW, PROHIBITION, RESTRICTION OR REGULATION.
